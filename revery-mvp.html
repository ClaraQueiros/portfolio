        Insomnia can lead to physical and mental health problems, and even misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatments.
        CBT-I has been proven to be an effective treatment for insomnia, with a success rate of 90% or higher, but
        access to therapists is limited.<br />
        Digital solutions are becoming more accessible and affordable, yet user retention is still a challenge. Studies
        suggest that in-app mood monitoring and human feedback could help improve user retention rates. Which could be
        addressed through pet- caring game mechanics. <br /><br />

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p style="display: inline;">Poor sleep has a serious impact on mental and physical health, often leading to
        misdiagnosis and unnecessary
        treatments.<br /><br />
        Doctors have recognized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) as the gold standard treatment for
        insomnia with over 30 years of research showing over 90% efficacy but there's less than 1,000 sleep therapists
        worldwide (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15402002.2016.1173551">source</a>).
        <br /><br />
        The lack of CBT-I resources is contributing to a global mental health crisis, with 2B+ adults suffering from
        insomnia and up to 3% of GDP lost in productivity.
        To avert a global mental health crisis, scientists are urging for CBT-I to be scaled up and made more
        accessible (<a
          href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341970674_The_Acute_Effects_of_the_COVID-19_Pandemic_on_Insomnia_and_Psychological_Symptoms">source</a>).

          going to sleep because that's when I'll think about if I have deals or if I have anything to do the next
          day. It's been that way for probably the last ten or 15 years.”</p>

          with keeping me asleep throughout the night.”</p>

        <p><b>Low retention on other digital solutions</b><br /></p>
        <p style="display: inline;">While digital platforms have increased affordability and access, yet low user
          retention remains a challenge.
          10,000+ mental health apps make it hard for patients to decide which ones to trust. Subjective user engagement
          indicators can be dangerous (<a
            href="https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ps.201800519">source</a>). Doctors can't assess
          the risks and benefits objectively (<a
            href="https://www.healio.com/news/psychiatry/20190408/standards-needed-to-assess-user-engagement-with-mental-health-apps">source</a>).
          Even
          with employer-funded programs, utilization rates are low (3-4%) (<a
            href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2165079915585054">source</a>).<br /><br />
          Studies have found that the dropout rate for mental health apps is high (<a
            href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31969272/">source</a>) but also that the dropout
          rate was lower in studies offering human feedback and in-app mood monitoring, which could be addressed through
          our pet- caring game mechanics.</p>
        <br /><br />
        </p>
        <p><b>Opportunity</b><br /></p>
        <p style="display: inline;">Casual games or avatar-based wellness apps have demonstrated significantly higher
          day 1 and day 30 retention
          rates compared to meditation apps. There is an opportunity to leverage the game modality and offer an
          effective and sustainable way to deliver CBT-I.<br /><br />
          Apart from increasing retention, the pet effect can be a great source of mental health support: habri’s survey
          revealed that 74% of pet owners saw an improvement in their mental wellbeing (<a
            href="https://habri.org/2016-pet-owners-survey">source</a>).</p>

          My role on user research went from planning (which method and research goals) to users recruitment, creating
          the research plan and organising insights.
          <br /><br />
          ● Some tools we used on our user research:<br />
          ● <a href="https://www.userinterviews.com/">User Interviews</a> - platform to recruit users<br />
          ● <a href="https://miro.com/">Miro</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/">FigJam</a> to create insights from
          user feedback<br />
          ● <a href="https://amplitude.com/">Amplitude</a> - for quantitative data<br />
          ● <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> - to plan and document each interview<br />
          ● <a href="https://www.looppanel.com/">Looppanel</a> - to auto-record and transcribe the interview<br />
          ● <a href="https://maze.co/">Maze</a> - to validate early concept ideas and running usability testing across
          prototypes and wireframes
          <br /><br />
          Since user research was shared by design and product, I created a User Research Repository, to centralise and
          make user research easily accessible to everyone, bringing awareness to user research.

        <p>The Kado Effect is the development of a digital symbiosis between the user and the game character. We’re
          establishing a link between out-of-game actions and in-game experience through a 24h core loop.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 64px;"><b>Sleep mode</b></p>
        <p>
          Kado is a virtual pet whose routine mirrors the user’s. At their bedtime, users put Kado to bed and they earn
          one Dream Mile for every minute that Kado is asleep. Kado wakes up if the user minimize the app or use their
          phone.
          <br />
          <br />
          This is how we’re directly incentivising the behaviours that lead to better sleep.
          Dream Miles are our game currency, where we built a system around, so the user can redeem them for items and
          activities that support Kado’s wellbeing.

        <p>After a few iterations and releases we got to a well-performing baseline. The foundation was in place so we
          could gather valuable data, optimise the journey, and start to introduce other core features to the journey.

            With a D1 Retention of 50.4% our initial hypothesis was that we would see the retention normally reserved
            for games. But we we’re also seeing the longterm retention ( D30 - 11%) that usually is seen in wellness
            apps.
