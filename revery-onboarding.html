      <h3>Being part of a team focused on creating positive change in people's lives is genuinely fulfilling for me and that’s why I joined Revery Labs. This case study explores the challenges and solutions we faced in optimizing the onboarding process for Revery’s Pocket Kado mobile app. Our goal was to enhance user conversion rates while managing a limited startup budget. The primary challenge was that despite successful user acquisition, the conversion to regular users was disappointingly low. This led to a detailed review and overhaul of the onboarding process, resulting in 80% increase in the conversion rate.

        <p><b>Problem/Opportunity</b></p>
      </div>
      <p class="body-small">
      Pocket Kado, a virtual pet mobile app using gamification and CBT-I for better sleep, faced a challenge a year after its launch. Despite effective marketing campaigns reaching over 500 users, the Cost Per Install (CPI) was high, and very few users became regulars. A deeper analysis identified the onboarding process as the core issue, being too complex and extensive, leading to a significant drop in user conversion to regular app engagement. <br /><br />
      </p>
      <div>
        <p><b>Solution</b></p>
      </div>
      <p class="body-small">
      To address this, a cross-functional team conducted a thorough review and rework of the onboarding process. This involved mapping the onboarding journey, funnel analysis, user feedback collection, and iterative design and hypothesis testing. The team streamlined the onboarding process, focusing on reducing non-essential elements and enhancing user understanding of the app's value.<br /><br />

      <h2>Role</h2>
      <p style="display: inline;">
      As the founding designer of Pocket Kado, I lead the design initiatives since October 2020, covering user research, UX/UI design, and art direction, while collaborating with an illustrator/animator, a product manager, developers, CTO, CEO, and mentoring a design intern. Despite the challenges of remote work across different time zones, our team's combined efforts led to Pocket Kado's successful global launch. </br>
I spearheaded the user interview process, integral for continuous learning and product iteration. My responsibilities encompassed creating interview plans, recruiting participants, and conducting interviews, alongside developing tailored scripts and prototypes. The insights gained from these interviews were crucial in refining the app's design to better meet user needs.

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p style="display: inline;">
      Pocket Kado is a virtual pet mobile app that uses gamification and CBT-I to help people get better sleep in a fun an accessible way. A year after the launch, Pocket Kado encountered a significant challenge: despite extensive marketing efforts, and after a substantial portion of our budget invested in various user acquisition strategies across multiple social platforms, our advertisements were not performing as expected. <br/> Although these campaigns succeeded in reaching over 500 users, the Cost Per Install (CPI) was disappointingly high and only a handful transitioned into regular app users. A deeper analysis revealed that the problem didn't lie within the marketing campaigns themselves. Instead, it was rooted in what happened after the download: a significant drop in user conversion to regular app engagement.<br/>
Upon reviewing the app, a prominent issue surfaced: the onboarding process. Its extensive and complex, posing a barrier to user engagement. We were determined to tackle this head-on, with an ambitious goal to dramatically boost our conversion rates.

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <div class="goal-description">
        <h3 style="text-align: left !important; font-family: Montserrat !important; font-weight: 700;">How did we manage to increase our onboarding conversion rate (CR) by 80%?</h3>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p><b>Collaborative Workshop and Team Structure</b><br /></p>
        <p style="display: inline;">
        We kicked off this project with a workshop, as we wanted to learn as much as we could.<br/>
Our cross-functional team - product manager, design, growth and engineering - is a key to our success, when each member contributes with their unique skills to streamline the onboarding process.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p><b>Objective: Minimize Time-to-Value</b><br /></p>
        <p style="display: inline;">
        Our goal was to reduce the time users take to recognize the value of the app.<br/>
The collaboration between the designer and product manager significantly drove this. Designers concentrated on creating an intuitive and visually engaging user interface, while product managers offered strategic insight into the app's functionality and alignment with user requirements. This partnership was key to provide a user experience that effectively communicated the app's value.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p><b>Funnel Analysis and Data-Driven Approach</b><br /></p>
        <p style="display: inline;">
        Comprehensive funnel tracking is essential and necessitates collaboration with your product manager. Such a partnership aligns onboarding with overarching goals, encourages cohesive problem-solving, enhances development efficiency, and guarantees that the onboarding experience fits the user's learning curve.<br/>
Our product manager's data-driven strategy played a crucial role in collecting detailed data about user touchpoints, guaranteeing that each event was covered.<br/>
Our experience showed that nearly 60% of users were lost during onboarding. Given our investment in user acquisition, this was a stark indicator of the need to rethink and enhance our onboarding approach.
        </p>

      <div class="goal-description">
        <p><b>Mapping the Onboarding Journey</b><br /></p>
        <p style="display: inline;">An essential part of our strategy was meticulously mapping the onboarding journey. The onboarding start the moment the user finds out about your app and it is important to map your onboarding journey step by step, going through each screen, each interaction, as it allows you to see the app from a user's perspective, identifying each touchpoint they encounter. This allowed us to view the app from the user's perspective, identifying potential drop-off points and areas for improvement.<br/><br/>
Our initial onboarding process was lengthy, overwhelming users with too much information. We refocused on reducing non-essential elements, aiming to shorten the time-to-value (TTV). We scrutinized each onboarding step, questioning its necessity in relation to our identified 'aha' moment. We employed a color-coding system (green, red, yellow) under each screen to prioritize essential elements and reconsider or remove others.</p>
        <br /><br />
        </p>
        <p><b>Opportunity</b><br /></p>
        <p style="display: inline;">Casual games or avatar-based wellness apps have demonstrated significantly higher
          day 1 and day 30 retention
          rates compared to meditation apps. There is an opportunity to leverage the game modality and offer an
          effective and sustainable way to deliver CBT-I.<br /><br />
          Apart from increasing retention, the pet effect can be a great source of mental health support: habri’s survey
          revealed that 74% of pet owners saw an improvement in their mental wellbeing (<a

A common theme was skepticism about the app's ability to directly improve sleep.</p>

          <p class="body-small" style="display: inline;">

            2. Focusing on the 'aha' moment and removing extra steps would direct users quickly to the app's value, increasing conversion rates.

        <p style="display: inline;">
        For a quick iteration on the same day, to test the two hypotheses, we prepared a prototype with a new simplified version of the onboarding. We conducted quick interviews with users to confirm our assumptions about their willingness to complete the entire onboarding process, and whether they understood and were eager to use the app.
